- the hardest part is making it run quickly with so many scanning boxes



-start 128s even farther down


- tracking performance now good
- tried to increase threshold in an attempt to get rid of the few false positives that show up
- hopefully this doesn't eliminate true positives as well
- if bad - can decrease the amount that gets added to the heatmap for each positive returned by the classifier
